# DryaptchaV2 - Python Version

This is the Python implementation of DryaptchaV2, migrating from the original Node.js version.

## Why the Switch?
- Too tired of finding the right versions in Node.js .

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DryaptchaV2-Python.git
