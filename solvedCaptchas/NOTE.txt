There are three captcha label files:

labelsOCR.json – This file contains captcha labels that were resolved by AI on March 17, 2025.

labelsGemini.json – This file contains captcha labels that were resolved by Gemini AI using a system
and then manually corrected. Initially, it had 31 errors out of 128 captchas, which were fixed on March 17, 2025.

labelsSmall.json – A smaller test file containing only two captchas to speed up testing without processing the full dataset.

These files are used for checking and labeling captchas. The Gemini file was fixed by hand to 
be more accurate. The small test file is for quick checks without taking too much time.
